<h1>Title : TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION </h1>


<h2>Introduction :</h2>
<p>This project revolves around analyzing the Titanic dataset, a common beginner's dataset containing details about passengers, including age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status. The primary aim is to  to determine whether a passenger survived or not. Through this exploration, we seek to uncover patterns within the data, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing survival outcomes on the Titanic.</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>In this project, we delve into the analysis of the Titanic dataset, drawing insights from the "titanic_survival.csv" file. This dataset is a valuable resource containing information about Titanic passengers, encompassing details such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and, most importantly, whether a passenger survived or not.</p>

<h2>Software Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Power Bi</li>

</ul>


<h2>Data Cleaning and Transforming</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Dataset contains many columns and data within it was not proper which was cleaned by using Microsoft Excel.</li>
  <li>The Cleaned .csv file was then loaded into Microsoft Power BI Software to perform analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Visualization</h2>
<p>A Power BI dashboard has been crafted to provide a comprehensive visual analysis of the Titanic dataset. Incorporating pie charts, bar graphs, joint bar graphs, and line graphs, the dashboard aims to vividly showcase both the survival rate and count of passengers. These visualizations serve to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, offering an interactive and insightful exploration of the factors influencing survival outcomes during the tragic event of the Titanic.</p>
